# Life 360

This is an unoffical app that connects to the Life 360 App to read location information of your mobile device. This is a first beta version and it works untill Life 360 change/kill the interface.

###
Please make sure that this app is my private work and therefore it will never be supported by Life360. LIfe360 endpoints and functionality can be changed every time. Using this App is on your risk. 

### v1.1.6
Small fix entering place.

### v1.1.5
Changed Capabities, added trigger battery charged, Fixed leaving/comming place trigger, added unvisible capebility for distance in KM (to use in logic fields). Please re-install all devices and check the flows (sorry). Made temporary fix for isDriving until api give this information (now isDrving is true when speed > 20).
Adjust logfiles to 50 lines and removed debuging information
